"For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about "
"downgrading to Emacs version 25.3.  We hope you will enjoy the greater "
"simplicity that results from the absence of many @w{Emacs @value{EMACSVER}} "

"Emacs no longer defaults to requiring the GnuTLS library when you build it.  "
"Those who want the TLS functionality built-in will have to explicitly "
"request it at build time---or forever hold their peace.  We decided that "
"having the TLS functionality doesn't justify annoying users or package "
"builders with error messages about libgnutls absence.  We also decided that "
"if you do build with GnuTLS, we will allow versions of the library older "
"than 2.12.2, as that version will become less and less available/popular as "
"you move farther back in time."

"For similar reasons, we've reverted back to building our own version of "
"@command{movemail} that retrieves POP3 mail as clear text via insecure "
"channels.  As you move back in time, the availability of secure alternatives "

"removed the @option{--with-mailutils} configure-time option, as it no longer "
"makes sense for the observable past."

"We have removed support for @command{systemd} and similar services: we no "

"services, and we removed from the Emacs server the socket-launching support "
"important for Emacs client operation under these services.  Again, these "
"services will lose popularity as you move back in time, so the code "
"supporting them will be just dead code, bloating Emacs unnecessarily."

"Emacs 25.3 no longer supports magic signatures of the form "
"@samp{#!/usr/bin/env @var{interpreter}} in scripts.  Moving back in time "
"means you are getting closer to the ideal of the original Unix design where "
"all the interpreters lived in a single directory @file{/bin}, so this fancy "

"The double-buffering feature of Emacs display on X has been removed.  We "
"decided that its complexity and a few random surprising side-effects aren't "
"justified by the gains, even though those gains were hailed in some "
"quarters.  Yes, Emacs 25.3 will flicker in some use cases, but we are sure "
"Emacs users will be able to suck it, as they have been doing for years.  "
"Since this feature is gone, we've also removed the "
"@code{inhibit-double-buffering} frame parameter, which is now unnecessary."

"Non-breaking hyphens and ASCII characters displayed instead of unsupported "

"we've removed the @code{header-line-highlight} face, leaving just "
"@code{highlight} for any element of the Emacs display besides the mode line."

"You can no longer disable attempts of recovery from fatal exceptions such as "

"@code{attempt-stack-overflow-recovery} and "
"@code{attempt-orderly-shutdown-on-fatal-signal} are therefore removed."

"The @code{list-timers} command was removed, as we decided timers are not a "
"user-level feature, and therefore users should not be allowed to mess with "
"them.  Ask an Emacs Lisp guru near you for help if you have a runaway timer "
"in your session.  (Of course, as you move back in time, such runaway timers "
"will become less and less frequent, and actually timers might start shutting "
"down automatically, as they cannot cope with time reversal.)"

"Horizontal scrolling using the mouse or touchpad has been removed.  In the "

"Displaying line numbers for a buffer is only possibly using add-on features, "
